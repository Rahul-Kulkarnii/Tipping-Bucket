# Forest Friendly Flow Gauge: DIY Tipping Bucket for Precise Interception Loss Estimation!
This is an Open Source Repository about fabricating your own DIY style Tipping Bucket Flow Gauge. The Goal of this specific instrument was to measure throughfall and stemflow, which is cruicial for measuring Interception Loss in Hydrological Budgeting.

## Background
Hydrological observation networks critical to advancement in hydrology are inadequate and yet declining. 
Interception losses are a major component in influencing the water yield of forested areas.
Commercial custom-built solutions for monitoring hydrological processes like through fall and stem flow, that govern total interception loss,â€¨are prohibitively expensive, resulting in sub-optimum sampling of data.
Low-cost instrumentation networks can improve monitoring resolution at a fractionally lower cost than traditional ones, which will increase accuracy of Hydrological Monitoring, and better inform Watershed Management.


## The Solution
We Designed and Developed this Low Cost, Open Source, 3D printed Tipping Bucket Flow Gauge.
You can go through this multiple sections in this repo to systematically tinker your own instrument(s).



## The Goal
The Goal of this project is to enable hydrologist and researchers to make their own open source 3D printed Tipping Bucket Flow Gauge, at a very low cost.
